    "## Plan for the Talk\n",
    "- Introduce Julia language and ecosystem as a potential tool for research in computational and experimental mathematics\n",
    "   - To get started with Julia we recommend the [Julia Academy](https://juliaacademy.com/courses) Introduction to Julia course. Note that the downloadable notebooks are more up to date than the video lectures.  \n",
    "   - Specifically, we will introduce [AbstractAlgebra.jl](https://nemocas.github.io/AbstractAlgebra.jl/latest/index.html), [BasicNT.jl](https://github.com/jmgraham30/BasicNT.jl), [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/stable/), [Distributions.jl](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/), and possibly others if time permits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Time permitting we will also introduce some associated tools for interoperability and sharing research results. For example,\n",
    "  - [Conda.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/Conda.jl), [PyCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl)\n",
    "  - [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl), [Weave.jl](http://weavejl.mpastell.com/stable/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a lot of additional resources related to this talk posted on my GitHub, see in particular [JuliaCompExpMath](https://github.com/jmgraham30/JuliaCompExpMath) and [BasicNT.jl](https://github.com/jmgraham30/BasicNT.jl). "

    "## What is the deal with [Julia](https://julialang.org/)?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Free, open source, and will run on most any platform. \n",
    "  - This means that almost anything you do using Julia is portable, say for example to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for large scale computing.  \n",
    "2. Dynamically typed and easy to program. \n",
    "  - Similar to Python or MATLAB\n",
    "3. **Fast** (the second time)\n",
    "  - Comparable with C. It's okay to write loops!\n",
    "4. Great interoperability (*e.g.*, with [Python](https://github.com/JuliaPy))\n",
    "\n",
    "For an excellent Julia tutorials check out [The Julia Academy](https://juliaacademy.com/courses). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some other interesting resources are [Statistics with Julia](https://github.com/h-Klok/StatsWithJuliaBook) and [Algorithms for Optimization](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-optimization). "
